# CYBERDUDEBIVASH's CyberEcosystem Toolkit

## Overview
CYBERDUDEBIVASH's CyberEcosystem Toolkit is a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment tool designed for ethical hacking and penetration testing. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Python and Tkinter, integrating features such as network scanning, enumeration, vulnerability analysis, exploitation (demo mode), and report generation. The toolkit is intended for use by security professionals and researchers with explicit permission to test target systems.

## Features
- **Network Scanning**: Perform basic and aggressive scans using `nmap` to identify hosts, open ports, and services.
- **Enumeration**: Enumerate open ports and running services to gather detailed system information.
- **Vulnerability Analysis**: Conduct Shodan searches (requires API key) and basic web vulnerability scans to identify potential weaknesses.
- **Exploitation**: Demo modes for SSH brute force and web exploitation, designed for ethical testing in controlled environments.
- **Report Generation**: Generate PDF reports summarizing findings using `reportlab`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Operating System: Linux, Windows, or macOS (Linux recommended for full `nmap` functionality)
- Dependencies:
  - `python-nmap`
  - `requests`
  - `reportlab`
  - `shodan`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `paramiko`

## Installation
1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cyberdudebivash-cyberecosystem-toolkit
   ```
   (Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual repository URL or download the source code manually.)

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install python-nmap requests reportlab shodan beautifulsoup4 paramiko
   ```

3. **Set Up Shodan API Key** (Optional, for vulnerability analysis):
   - Sign up for a Shodan account at [shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/).
   - Obtain your API key from your Shodan account.
   - Set the API key as an environment variable:
     ```bash
     export SHODAN_API_KEY='your-api-key'
     ```
     (On Windows, use `set SHODAN_API_KEY=your-api-key` in Command Prompt.)

4. **Run the Toolkit**:
   ```bash
   python cyber_toolkit.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Launch the Toolkit**:
   - Run `python cyber_toolkit.py` to open the GUI.
   - The interface includes tabs for Scanning, Enumeration, Vulnerability Analysis, Exploitation, and Report Generation.

2. **Set a Target**:
   - Enter the target IP address or URL in the "Target" field (e.g., `192.168.1.1` or `example.com`).
   - Click "Set Target" to confirm.

3. **Perform Assessments**:
   - **Scanning**: Choose between Basic or Aggressive scan and click "Run Scan" to identify hosts and ports.
   - **Enumeration**: Select Port or Service enumeration and click "Run Enumeration" to gather system details.
   - **Vulnerability Analysis**: Choose Shodan Search or Web Vulnerability Scan and click "Run Analysis" to identify weaknesses.
   - **Exploitation**: Select SSH Brute Force or Web Exploit (demo modes) and click "Run Exploit" for simulated testing.
   - **Report Generation**: Click "Generate PDF Report" to save a summary of findings as a PDF file.

4. **View Output**:
   - Results are displayed in the Output area at the bottom of the GUI.
   - Scroll through the text to review scan results, errors, or status messages.

## Ethical Considerations
- **Authorized Use Only**: Use this toolkit only on systems you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning or exploitation is illegal and unethical.
- **Demo Mode for Exploitation**: The exploitation features are in demo mode to prevent misuse. Customize them only in controlled, authorized environments.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure sensitive data collected during assessments is handled securely and complies with applicable laws and regulations.

## Troubleshooting
- **Nmap Issues**: Ensure `nmap` is installed on your system (`sudo apt install nmap` on Debian-based systems or equivalent for other OS).
- **Shodan Errors**: Verify your API key is set correctly and your account has sufficient credits.
- **GUI Freezing**: Operations are threaded to prevent freezing, but high-intensity scans may take time. Check the Output area for progress.
- **Permission Errors**: Run the script with elevated privileges (`sudo`) if required for certain `nmap` scans.
